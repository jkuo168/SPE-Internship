# SPE-Internship

Final Project created during SPE Internship 2019. Web application allows Princeton University students to create draw groups for the university's Room Draw. Similar to a CRUD application, students can login and create a group. Application is also able to manage accepting/declining a draw group if another student has included them in their group. At the end, students can verify their draw group has been created and saved.
